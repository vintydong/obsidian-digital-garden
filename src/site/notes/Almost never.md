>If you choose a random number, what is the probability that the chosen number was $8$?

The answer depends on the number of possible choices. If you were choosing a number from the range from $1$ to $10$, it would be $\frac{1}{10}$.

If you were choosing from an infinite range of numbers, the probability of this happening is $0$. We say it ***almost never*** happens. This specific term refers to events that have a 0 probability of happening.

Impossible events cannot happen because they are not within the set of possible events. Getting a 7 from a dice roll is said to be impossible.

For finite sets of events, such as a dice roll, almost never and never means the same thing. The probability of rolling a 7 on a standard dice is 0. We could say that this almost never happens but it never happens because this is an impossible event.

Consider choosing a number from the infinite number line: it is ***possible*** to choose 8 but very very very very unlikely. It's inaccurate to say that it is impossible to choose 8 or this event will never happen because it is possible -- that is, it is within the set of possible events.

The event of choosing 8 almost never happens with a probability of 0. Note that there is an equivalent expression: the event of not choosing 8 almost surely (or almost always) happens.
