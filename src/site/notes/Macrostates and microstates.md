Consider a container of gas particles with a certain temperature. From a macroscopic point of view, we see only one state: the temperature. However, there are more than one microstates that can achieve the same macroscopic effect. The gas particles could be arranged differently and yet the temperature would remain the same.

In this way, microstates are different ways of achieving the same macroscopic condition. The more microstates associated with a particular macrostate, the more likely the macrostate[^1].


## Examples
The first law thermodynamics state that the total energy of an isolated system must remain constant. This is consistent with the idea of macrostates and microstates.

The total energy of a system is a macrostate that can be achieved through numerous microstates. The energy of individual particles may fluctuate within the system, but since all of these microstates are associated with a single macrostate, it appears macroscopically the same.

[^1]: This is assuming that all microstates are equally likely at every time step.
