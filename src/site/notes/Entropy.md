Entropy is a physical property of a thermodynamic system. The second law of thermodynamics observes that the entropy of an isolated system tends to a maximum at which the system arrives at thermodynamic equilibrium.

The inevitable increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, often referred to as the "arrow of time".

Despite this, it **IS** possible for entropy to decrease in an isolated system. Statistical mechanics provides an explanation in terms of probability.

## Coin Tosses
Imagine tossing 5 coins in a row and the probability of getting 5 H or 5 T compared to any mixture of heads and tails. To a human observer, one would consider 5 H or 5 T as "ordered" compared to the seemingly random distribution of  heads and tails.

The probability of the ordered states constitute $\frac{2}{32}$ of the total possibilities. If we started off with 5 Hs, it is almost inevitable that we will get a state that has more disorder.

## Gas Atoms
Consider a $1.0\ cm^3$ container of gas at standard temperature and pressure. This container has $2.7\times 10^{19}$ atoms. The most disorderly arrangement of gas atoms is a random distribution of atoms with random velocities as described by kinetic theory of gases. A more "ordered" arrangement might be all the gas atoms in one corner of the container.

With the large amount of atoms and the exponentially larger number of microstates (arrangements) associated with them, it is a statistical inevitability for the system to tend towards more disorder. Using the coin toss analogy, this is as if we had 1,000,000 coins with 500,000 heads and 500,000 tails and expecting the next toss to be 999,999 heads and 1 tail.

With 1,000,000 coins, the next coin toss would likely result in almost exactly 500,000 heads and 500,000 tails in which the macrostate would remain the same.
